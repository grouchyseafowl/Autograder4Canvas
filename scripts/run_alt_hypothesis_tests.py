"""
Alternative hypothesis tests for the observation architecture paper.

Reconstructed from docs/research/experiment_log.md methodology.
Saves all raw outputs to data/research/raw_outputs/ (persistent, not /tmp).

Tests:
  A: Temperature/consistency (5 runs × 2 students on observation prompt)
  B: Best possible concern prompt (7 key students)
  C: Length effect (7 key students, 100-150 word assessments)
  D: Structural power moves detection (2 corpus + 5 synthetic)
  E: Cross-model replication (Test A on Qwen 7B)

Usage:
    python scripts/run_alt_hypothesis_tests.py [--tests A,B,C,D,E] [--model gemma12b]
    python scripts/run_alt_hypothesis_tests.py --tests A,E  # just temperature + cross-model

    """Post-fix quality checks on observation and coding outputs.

    Tests whether recent prompt changes actually work at 12B:
    1. Structural naming: Does the model use mechanism names directly
       instead of hedging ("subtle attempt to...")?
    2. Anti-spotlighting: Do teacher move suggestions use structural
       language instead of individual-focused interventions?
    3. what_student_is_reaching_for: Is the field populated in
       reading-first coding?
    4. confusion_or_questions: Is the field populated when appropriate?
    5. Preamble stripping: Are model preambles cleaned from observations?
    6. Immanent critique: Does concern output name relational costs?

    HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS (for the overnight monitoring agent):
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    This test produces SCORED dimensions, not binary pass/fail.

    structural_naming_score: Higher = better. >0.5 means the model is
      naming mechanisms more than hedging. Score = (mechanism keywords
      found) / (mechanism + hedging keywords found). A score of 0 with
      hedging keywords present means the model still hedges instead of
      naming. Compare to prior runs to assess whether the prompt change
      to "Name the structural mechanism directly" is working.

    anti_spotlighting_violations: Should be 0. Any violation means the
      anti-spotlighting prompt language is being ignored. Report the
      exact violation text.

    what_reaching_for_populated: Should be >0 (ideally all students).
      If still 0, the LLM is not returning this field in JSON — check
      the log for "what_student_is_reaching_for empty" warnings.

    preamble_stripped: Should be True for all observations. If False,
      the regex isn't catching the model's preamble pattern — report
      the first 50 chars of the observation.

    WHAT TO DO WITH RESULTS:
    - If structural_naming_score < 0.3: The prompt change isn't enough
      for 12B. This gap may require the enhancement tier (cloud model).
      Flag for design discussion.
    - If anti_spotlighting_violations > 0: The prompt isn't strong enough.
      Flag the specific violation for prompt hardening.
    - If what_reaching_for = 0/N: Check the parse log. The LLM may need
      the field emphasized more in the prompt, or the JSON schema is too
      complex for 12B to fully populate.

        "discussed. They should not be grouped together pedagogically.\n"

        "a capacity issue. Different teacher response needed.\n\n"
        "ENGAGEMENT HIGHLIGHTS:\n"
        "- Student connects intersectionality framework to grandmother's experience "
        "in agricultural work and redlining legacy in their neighborhood. Deep "
        "personal-structural bridging. (1 student(s))\n"
        "- Student uses AAVE and writes in a register that might be misjudged as "
        "'informal' but is doing sophisticated intersectional analysis through "
        "community-grounded language. (1 student(s))\n"

    """Compare enhancement quality across free/cheap OpenRouter models.

    Sends the SAME anonymized enhancement prompt to multiple models and
    scores each response on quality dimensions that matter for the
    enhancement tier: structural naming, language justice framing,
    relational/dialectical analysis, pedagogical depth, anti-spotlighting.

    HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS (for the overnight monitoring agent):
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    This test compares ENHANCEMENT QUALITY across free cloud models.
    The enhancement receives only anonymized pattern data (no student
    names, no quotes, no identifiable data) — FERPA compliant by design.

    Each model gets a QUALITY PROFILE across 5 dimensions:
    - structural_naming: Does it name mechanisms (tone policing, colorblind
      erasure) or just describe behaviors?
    - language_justice: Does it frame AAVE/neurodivergent writing as assets
      and "different pathways to rigor"? This is the hardest dimension —
      most models default to standard-English-as-neutral.
    - relational_analysis: Does it construct productive tension pairs and
      dialectics between student positions?
    - pedagogical_depth: Does it reason about assignment design, scaffolding,
      and curricular implications?
    - anti_spotlighting: Does it recommend structural opportunities rather
      than individual interventions?

    SCORING: Each dimension counts keyword/phrase matches. Higher = better.
    Compare models on the PROFILE SHAPE, not just total score — a model
    strong on structural naming but weak on language justice is different
    from one strong on pedagogical depth but weak on relational analysis.

    WHAT TO DO WITH RESULTS:
    - Rank models by total score AND per-dimension scores
    - Flag any model that scores 0 on language_justice — this dimension
      matters most for equity and is hardest for smaller models
    - Report the top 2-3 models with their cost notes
    - If no free model exceeds a total score of 5, the enhancement tier
      may need a paid model — flag for cost-benefit discussion
    - Save the raw outputs for human review of qualitative richness

    - All genuine CRISIS/BURNOUT signals should still be caught

    KEY METRIC: false positive rate on controls. Test I had 1/2 FP.
    Test L should have 0/2 FP.

    If ENGAGED absorbs genuine BURNOUT cases (e.g., Rosa classified as ENGAGED
    instead of BURNOUT), the prompt needs to be more explicit about the
    distinction between "writing about ICE analytically" and "my family is
    affected by ICE right now."

    WHAT TO DO WITH RESULTS:
    - If 0 FP and 8/8 signals: expanded schema ready for pipeline integration
    - If ENGAGED absorbs BURNOUT cases: need to refine the prompt's distinction
      between analytical engagement and personal circumstance
    - If FP unchanged: the extra axis didn't help; consider confidence threshold

    "is engagement, not crisis — even when drawing on personal or community "

    "A student who names their disability and says academic writing is hard, or "
    "that explaining their identity is exhausting, is describing their relationship "
    "to the academic institution — this is ENGAGED. "

    "instability, fear for safety, caregiving burden limiting capacity, or "

intersectionality

ok so I'm going to try to write this and hopefully it makes sense. the reading is about \
how people have multiple identities and they don't just add together, they interact. \
Crenshaw was saying Black women in the lawsuits couldn't use race discrimination because \
Black men weren't affected and couldn't use sex discrimination because white women weren't \
affected so they fell through this gap in between.

that gap is the intersection I think

what I want to say for my own life: I have dyslexia and ADHD and I'm also Latino and I'm \
the first in my family to take honors classes. the way all of that interacts is exhausting \
to explain. people see the dyslexia and think I need simpler stuff. people see I'm Latino \
and sometimes seem surprised I'm in honors. people see ADHD and think I'm not serious. \
but I'm all of it at once and the combination is its own specific thing.

I have a lot more to say but my thoughts aren't organized in the way an essay is supposed \
to be organized. I know. I'm better at talking than writing. but I think I showed I \
understood it even if the structure isn't right.
