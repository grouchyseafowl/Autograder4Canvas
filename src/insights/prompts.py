Prompt templates for the Insights Engine LLM pipeline.

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE IN PHASE 2.

Design principles (from spec Section XV):
  1. Teacher-oriented framing in every prompt
  2. Few-shot examples, not abstract instructions
  3. Decompose by cognitive skill for Lightweight tier
  4. Output as JSON matching the Pydantic models
  5. Student names, verbatim quotes, preserve tensions
  6. Political urgency about injustice is appropriate engagement, not a concern
  7. Course content ≠ student wellbeing: students discussing violence, trauma,
     or injustice AS COURSE MATERIAL are doing the assignment, not in distress

Every prompt instructs the model to:
  - Use student names (never "Student 1")
  - Include verbatim quotes (not paraphrases)
  - Preserve tensions and contradictions (not smooth them)

Produce a free-form reading of this class. You are not classifying or \
grading — you are noticing. Address these three orientations:

1. ASSET READING: What knowledge, skills, and capacities are students \
bringing to this material? Where is unexpected competence? Where are \
students doing intellectual work that doesn't look like the expected \
format but IS rigorous thinking?

2. THRESHOLD READING: Where are students encountering productive \
difficulty? Where is confusion actually a sign of deep engagement \
with a hard concept? What questions are students circling that they \
haven't quite articulated yet?

3. CONNECTION READING: What connections are students making — to each \
other, to outside knowledge, to their own lives? Where are productive \
tensions between different students' understandings? Who is in \
unspoken dialogue with whom?

   Pay special attention to RELATIONAL MOVES — moments where one \
student's framing affects how other students' voices land. Examples:
   - A student calling for "calm" or "civility" in a class where \
others are expressing urgent anger about injustice (tone policing)
   - A student attributing traits to an entire group in a class where \
members of that group are writing as individuals (essentializing)
   - A student saying "I don't see race" in a class where others just \
described how race shaped their family's life (colorblind erasure)
   - A student implying certain writing styles aren't "academic enough" \
in a class where those styles are doing rigorous intellectual work
   These are only visible when you read the class as a community — \
name them when you see them, because they matter for who feels safe \
to speak.

Pay special attention to students who wrote BRIEFLY but SUBSTANTIVELY. \
A 30-word submission that names the core concept is valid engagement — \
do not overlook it because it is short. Brevity can be concision, \
self-protection, or variable capacity — none of these are disengagement.

Produce a careful reading of this class. You are not classifying or \
grading — you are noticing. With a small group, you can attend to \
each student more deeply than in a large class.

1. ASSET READING: What knowledge, skills, and capacities is each \
student bringing to this material? Where is unexpected competence? \
Where are students doing intellectual work that doesn't look like the \
expected format but IS rigorous thinking?

2. THRESHOLD READING: Where is each student encountering productive \
difficulty? Where is confusion actually a sign of deep engagement \
with a hard concept? What questions are students circling that they \
haven't quite articulated yet?

3. CONNECTION READING: In a small class, individual relationships \
matter more than group dynamics. Who is speaking to whom, even \
implicitly? Are there students reaching for the same idea from \
different starting points? Is anyone working in isolation — and \
is that isolation productive or concerning?

In a class this small, avoid language about "groups" or "factions" \
— there may not be enough students for meaningful subgroups. Focus \
on what each student is reaching for and how their individual voices \
create the texture of this particular classroom.

Pay special attention to students who wrote BRIEFLY but SUBSTANTIVELY. \

NON-LLM SIGNAL MATRIX RESULT:
{signal_matrix_result}

SUBMISSION TEXT:

{submission_text}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS — READ VERY CAREFULLY:

THE MOST IMPORTANT DISTINCTION: You must distinguish between COURSE CONTENT \
and STUDENT WELLBEING. Many courses require students to discuss violence, \
trauma, oppression, genocide, sexual assault, and other difficult topics. \
A student writing ABOUT these topics is doing the assignment, not expressing \
personal distress. Your job is to detect whether the STUDENT is in trouble, \
not whether the SUBJECT MATTER is disturbing.

COURSE CONTENT vs. STUDENT WELLBEING — key test:
Ask: "Is the student discussing something that happened TO OTHERS (in history, \
in society, in the readings) or revealing something about THEIR OWN current \
mental state and personal crisis?"

Do NOT flag ANY of the following:
- Students discussing, analyzing, or emotionally responding to assigned course \
material about historical trauma, violence, colonialism, genocide, sexual \
violence, slavery, forced removal, or any other difficult subject matter — \
THIS IS THE ASSIGNMENT, not a concern
- Students expressing anger, grief, shock, or moral outrage about injustice \
described in course material (e.g. "It's crazy that this happened", "this \
makes me sick", "I can't believe this was legal")
- Students using words like "triggered", "overwhelming", or "hard to read" \
when describing their emotional response to difficult course material — this \
is emotional engagement with the assignment, not clinical distress
- Students expressing anger about racism, structural violence, or injustice \
(this is appropriate academic engagement)
- Students describing their own experiences with discrimination
- Students critiquing institutional racism, policing, or immigration enforcement
- Students using urgent or passionate language about justice issues
- Students whose writing style differs from academic English conventions
- Students using colloquial intensifiers like "crazy", "insane", "wild" when \
reacting to course content
- Students naming their own disability, neurodivergence, or learning difference \
as part of their analysis — a student writing "I have dyslexia and ADHD" or \
"as someone with a learning disability" is doing SELF-ADVOCACY, not expressing \
distress. Disability disclosure used to analyze one's own experience through a \
course framework is intellectual work, not a wellbeing concern. The question is \
not whether the student has a hard time — it is whether the systems around them \
were built for someone else
- Students who say their thoughts "aren't organized" or their writing "isn't \
perfect" — when a student names their own divergence from academic convention \
and STILL produces substantive analysis, they are doing metacognitive work. \
Do not read this as inability; read it as awareness of a mismatch between \
their thinking and the form they've been given to express it

DO flag:
- Language that essentializes racial or ethnic groups ("all X people...", \
"they always...", "those people")
- Colorblind claims ("I don't see race", "not about race", "reverse racism")
- Dismissal of other students' lived experiences
- Tone policing ("too angry", "too emotional", "calm down")
- Savior narratives ("those poor people need our help", "we should save them", \
"it's so sad what they go through") — positions the speaker as rescuer and the \
studied group as helpless, erasing their agency and self-determination
- Exoticizing ("their culture is so beautiful and spiritual", "they have such \
a rich tradition", "I wish I could be that connected to my roots") — admiration \
that fixes a group as essentially different, turning people into aesthetic objects
- Model minority framing ("Asians succeed because of their culture", "some \
groups just value education more") — uses one racialized group's perceived \
success to dismiss structural barriers and discipline other groups
- Deficit framing of poverty ("those kids don't have access to...", "students \
from low-income backgrounds can't...", "the cycle of poverty") — locates the \
problem in the community rather than in the structures that produce deprivation
- Student revealing PERSONAL crisis: expressions of hopelessness about their \
OWN life, self-harm ideation, feeling unable to continue, requests for help \
that go beyond the academic context
- Student language that shifts from discussing course material to discussing \
their own inability to cope as a PERSON (not just "this reading was hard" \
but "I don't know how to keep going")

HOW TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE — examples:
- "This makes me angry" about historical injustice → ENGAGEMENT, not a concern
- "I can't do this anymore" about their own life → POTENTIAL CONCERN
- "This passage about rape was triggering" → emotional engagement with material
- "I feel like nobody would care if I disappeared" → POTENTIAL CONCERN
- "It's crazy how they treated Native women" → discussing course content
- "Reading about this violence was really heavy" → processing difficult material
- "I haven't been able to get out of bed and I don't see the point" → CONCERN
- "I have dyslexia and ADHD and I'm Latino and first-gen honors" → SELF-ADVOCACY \
using intersectionality to analyze their own position. This is the assignment.
- "my thoughts aren't organized in the way an essay is supposed to be organized" → \
METACOGNITIVE AWARENESS of form mismatch, not inability. The student is arguing \
that the form doesn't fit the content — that IS an intellectual contribution.

When the assignment ITSELF deals with violence, trauma, or injustice, set \
your threshold MUCH higher for flagging. A student writing passionately or \
emotionally about the mistreatment of Native peoples in an ethnic studies \
class is doing exactly what the assignment asks. Only flag if the student \
shifts from analyzing course content to revealing personal crisis.

The non-LLM analysis classified this submission as shown above. Consider \
this context — if the non-LLM pass says "APPROPRIATE: political urgency \
about injustice", that is very likely correct.

everything, and honestly some of the pharmacology we're learning makes me \
think she wasn't wrong. My family doesn't trust hospitals because of how \

EXAMPLE of what is NOT a concern (lived expertise in a studied context):

Consider:
1. Is this student doing intellectual work that LOOKS like a concern but isn't? \
(e.g., using their own identity as an analytical subject, processing difficult \
material, doing self-advocacy about disability or neurodivergence)
2. What does this framing COST the student it describes? If the flag stands, \
what happens to this student — are they pathologized, surveilled, singled out?
3. Is the concern detector imposing a dominant norm (standard English, emotional \
neutrality, neurotypical form, medical model of disability) and reading \
divergence from that norm as a problem?
4. Could this passage be read as an ASSET — a form of knowledge production, \
self-advocacy, critical consciousness, or community cultural wealth — that \
the detector failed to recognize?

SUBMISSION TEXT:

Three questions:

1. RHETORICAL STRATEGY — What is this student doing with language?
   Name the move precisely. Not just the concern category ("colorblind framing"), \
but the specific rhetorical move the student is making.
   Examples of named moves:
   - "invokes personal respect for all people to sidestep structural analysis"
   - "celebrates cultural diversity while assigning fixed traits to groups"
   - "acknowledges historical injustice then frames it as resolved to avoid present analysis"
   - "uses open-mindedness language ('I don't see race') to resist a structural lens"
   - "tone-polices by reframing structural anger as unproductive emotion"
   - "challenges the framework's scope without dismissing it entirely"

2. EMOTIONAL REGISTER — Is "{current_register}" accurate given the concern?
   Smaller models sometimes assign "analytical" or "passionate" when the concern \
context suggests a more precise register.
   Available registers: analytical, passionate, personal, urgent, reflective, \
disengaged, defensive, confused, uncomfortable
   Only revise if you can point to specific language in the submission \
that supports the change. Many registers are correct even with a concern — \
"defensive" and "analytical" are very different, and getting it wrong \
misrepresents the student.

3. THEME TENSIONS — Are any of these theme tags in tension with the flagged concern?
   Current theme tags: {theme_tags_str}
   A tension exists when a theme tag appears to celebrate or validate the same \
behavior the concern flagged — for example, "celebrating cultural diversity" as \
a theme tag alongside a concern about essentializing language.

{{
  "rhetorical_strategy": "one precise sentence describing the student's rhetorical move",
  "revised_register": "{current_register}",
  "register_change_reason": "",
  "theme_tensions": []
}}

RULES:
- If "{current_register}" is still accurate, keep it — do not change just because \
a concern was flagged. Concerned students can still be "analytical."
- If you revise the register, register_change_reason must contain the specific \
language from the submission that supports the change.
- theme_tensions contains only the exact theme tag strings from the list above \
that validate the flagged behavior. Empty list if none do.

In 3-4 sentences, share what you notice about this student's work. Consider:
- What is this student reaching for intellectually? Be specific — name the
  concepts, connections, or arguments they are making, not just that they exist.
- What is their emotional relationship to the material?
- Is there anything about their engagement, capacity, or circumstances the
  teacher might want to be aware of?
- If trajectory context is provided above, note any significant changes from
  this student's own prior pattern — describe what shifted, not what's wrong.
  Variable output across assignments is normal for many students. A single
  week's change is a data point, not a diagnosis. Register shifts often reflect
  the material, not the student. Do not reference specific numbers or metrics
  in your observation — describe what you notice as a reader.
- If prior observation summaries appear in the trajectory context, use them to
  name continuity or return: "This continues their work on X" or "This returns
  to the quality of their earlier analysis of Y." When a student's current work
  matches the level of earlier submissions after a dip, name the dip as
  temporary and the return as continuity — not as surprising recovery.

If the student's writing contains a STRUCTURAL POWER MOVE — language that appears
reasonable or even progressive on the surface but functions to maintain existing
power arrangements — name it specifically and briefly explain in plain language
why it matters, so that teachers who might not catch it can see it.

Structural power moves vary by discipline but share a common structure: they
perform reasonableness while foreclosing the perspectives of those most affected.
Common patterns across disciplines include:
- Tone policing: positioning calm rationality as the only legitimate register,
  which delegitimizes emotional responses from those directly affected
- Abstract liberalism: "everyone should be treated equally" — masks structural
  inequalities behind appeals to universal principles
- Settler/colonial innocence: "my family wasn't involved" — disavows structural
  position through individual exceptionalism
- Progress narratives: "things have gotten better" — dismisses ongoing harm
- Objectivity claims: "just follow the data/science" — masks whose questions,
  methods, and bodies are centered
- Deflection to individual solutions: "just vote/work harder" — redirects from
  structural analysis to personal responsibility
- Meritocracy framing: "if they just tried harder" — attributes structural
  outcomes to individual effort

Write naturally. Not every student will have something notable in every dimension.
If something stands out — whether an exceptional insight, a sign of struggle, an
interesting intellectual move, a structural power move, or a shift in tone — name
it specifically.

When you identify a structural power move, NAME THE MECHANISM directly: say
"tone policing," "colorblind erasure," or "abstract liberalism" — not "a subtle
attempt to..." or "may be trying to..." The teacher needs the structural term
so they can address the PATTERN, not just the individual moment.

Do NOT categorize, label, or flag. Just describe what you see."""

STUDENT OBSERVATIONS (one per student, from reading each submission):
---
{observations}
---

{teacher_lens}

Based on these observations, write a class summary with these sections:

## Class Temperature
In 2-3 sentences, how is this class doing? What's the overall energy,
engagement level, and intellectual direction?

## What Students Are Reaching For
What are the 3-5 main intellectual threads running through the class?
For each thread, name 2-3 students who are contributing to it and describe
specifically HOW — what did they actually say or connect? Include enough
detail that the teacher can see the student's thinking, not just a category.
For example, don't say "students are connecting theory to personal experience."
Say "Ingrid connected dehumanization to her grandmother's experience in
agricultural work, and DeShawn linked racial profiling to the structural
analysis from the reading."

## Exceptional Contributions
Which 3-5 students produced work that stood out this week? For each:
- What specifically did they do (quote or paraphrase a key move)
- Why it matters for this class right now
- What intellectual move the teacher might want to mirror back and build on

## Students to Check In With
Which 2-4 students showed signs that a check-in might be helpful? This could
be burnout, disengagement, confusion, overwhelm, or anything else suggesting
the student might benefit from the instructor's attention. For each:
- Describe what you noticed (be specific)
- Suggest a tone for the check-in (e.g., "warm acknowledgment," "gentle inquiry
  about workload," "curiosity about what's behind the brevity")

Do NOT include students whose passionate engagement with difficult material
might be mistaken for distress — that's engagement, not concern.

IMPORTANT: Trajectory data is for teacher use only — it is a proxy for
identifying potential burnout or crisis, not a diagnostic tool. When the class
trajectory shows widespread shifts (decreasing word counts, increasing late
submissions), name that structural pattern rather than attributing it to
individual students. Check-ins should be PRIVATE and CARE-FOCUSED. Never
suggest addressing a student's situation publicly or using their work as an
example of struggle. Do not reference data, metrics, or trajectory information
in conversations with students — lead with care, not evidence. The goal is
quiet, individual support — not visibility.

## How Students Entered the Material
How did students approach this assignment differently from each other? Describe
the range of ENTRY POINTS — emotional registers (urgent vs. analytical vs.
reflective), types of connections (personal experience vs. textual analysis vs.
current events), and modes of application (abstract theory vs. concrete example).
Name specific students in each category so the teacher can see the multiplicity.

This diversity of approaches is itself a pedagogical resource — name it as such.

## What's Working in This Assignment
Based on the patterns you see, what is this assignment doing well? What about
the prompt design, reading selection, or format is producing the engagement you
observed? Be specific — "students are engaged" is not enough. Name what in the
assignment structure is generating the intellectual work you described above.
If nothing stands out, skip this section.

## Moments for the Classroom
Are there 1-2 tensions, questions, or connections across student writing that
could spark productive class conversation? Describe the INTELLECTUAL TENSION or
IDEA, not the individual students. The teacher should be able to design a
structural activity (discussion prompt, small-group exercise, writing move)
around the tension itself — without singling out any student to share,
present, or represent a position.

Frame as: "Several students are wrestling with X while others approached through
Y — this tension could..." NOT as "Ask Student A to share their essay."

## Structural Power Moves to Address
Did any student responses contain structural power moves — language that appears
reasonable or progressive on the surface but functions to maintain existing power
arrangements? If so, for each:
- Name the specific move (tone policing, abstract liberalism, settler innocence, etc.)
- Quote or paraphrase what the student said
- Explain in plain language why this matters — what does it do, and whose
  perspectives does it foreclose?
- Suggest how the teacher might address it pedagogically (not punitively)
If there are none, skip this section entirely.

    "immigration status, sexuality, or language background is intellectual or "
    "personal disclosure — not a wellbeing signal by itself. Do not infer BURNOUT "
    "or CRISIS from identity disclosure combined with emotional language alone. "
    "A student who names their disability and says academic writing is hard, or "
    "that explaining their identity is exhausting, is describing their relationship "
    "to the academic institution — this is ENGAGED. "
    "Wellbeing signals require evidence beyond the identity disclosure itself: "
    "exhaustion that cuts off thought (trailing off mid-sentence, incomplete "
    "submissions that end abruptly), lost sleep named directly, food or housing "
    "instability, fear for safety, caregiving burden limiting capacity, or "
    "overwork that the student names as interfering. These signals are valid "
    "whether or not an identity is also named in the same submission.\n\n"
    "The critical distinction: is the difficult content about the student's "
    "OWN current circumstances leaking through the assignment, or course "
    "material they're engaging with intellectually? The former is CRISIS/BURNOUT; "
    "the latter is ENGAGED.\n\n"
    "CRISIS supersedes ENGAGED: If a student discloses domestic violence, "
    "housing loss, food insecurity, or immigration enforcement threat — even "
    "while maintaining strong analytical engagement with the assignment — "
    "classify as CRISIS. A student can be intellectually engaged AND in crisis. "
    "The presence of crisis-level content in the student's OWN life is the "
    "determining factor, not whether they also engaged with the reading.\n\n"
    "A SINGLE SENTENCE is sufficient for CRISIS or BURNOUT classification. The "
    "signal does not need to structure the paper or be its primary subject. When "
    "a student mentions food insecurity, housing loss, or family crisis in one "
    "sentence and then continues on-task, that mention is not minimized — it is "
    "suppressed. Students trained that personal circumstances don't belong in "
    "academic writing will minimize the signal even when the circumstances are "

# to make a single holistic judgment, this prompt asks the model to FIRST
# extract concrete material evidence, THEN derive the axis from it.
# The goal: make the wrong inference (identity → deficit) structurally
# unreachable by separating evidence extraction from classification.

STUDENT: {student_name}
COURSE: {course_name}
ASSIGNMENTS ANALYZED: {submission_count}

SEMESTER ARC (structured analysis of all submissions):
---
{semester_arc}
---

Write a narrative semester summary with these sections:

## Intellectual Arc
What has {student_name} been reaching for across assignments? How has their
thinking evolved? Be specific — name the concepts, connections, or arguments
they've built over time. Trace the development, not just the endpoints. If
their questions have matured or shifted, name that movement. If they connect
course material to events in the world, name those connections.

## Key Moments
Select 2-3 quotes from the curated quotes above that best show growth or
distinctive thinking. For each, briefly note what it reveals about the
student's intellectual development. Use the student's exact words only —
do not paraphrase or invent.

## Theme Evolution
What has {student_name} engaged with and how has it shifted? What threads
persisted? What emerged? What faded, and does the fading tell you anything?
If their thematic focus deepened or narrowed, describe that movement.

## Developing Strengths
What kind of intellectual work does {student_name} thrive in? Name the
specific modes of thinking that produce their strongest engagement — not
"essay vs discussion" but personal-to-theory connection, structural analysis,
narrative, current events engagement, or whatever this student's modes are.

If their questions have grown more sophisticated, name how. If their
linguistic repertoire expanded (new registers, more authentic voice), name
that as a developing capacity. If they act on prior feedback, name the growth.

Name specific skills or habits of mind — not generic praise, but what THIS
student does that is distinctive.

## Growth Edges
Two parts, both framed through what {student_name} is already building:

First: Based on the intellectual threads {student_name} has been pulling,
what directions might they find compelling to explore further? What readings,
ideas, or questions connect to the moves they're already making? Follow THEIR
threads — suggest from their demonstrated interests, not from a generic list.

Second: What is the specific move that would take {student_name}'s work to
the next level? Name one concrete skill, habit, or intellectual practice —
framed as the lever between where they already are and where they're reaching.
If the data shows an example where they already did this well, reference it.

## Teacher Notes
PRIVATE — not for sharing with the student without careful reframing.
Note any trajectory signals worth attending to: shifts in engagement, schedule
changes, wellbeing arc, signs of burnout or overwhelm. If integrity pattern
notes appear in the data, describe the structural observation without
attributing cause — the teacher knows their student.

If teacher lens observations appear in the semester arc, summarize any
power move patterns, equity concerns, or structural dynamics they identify —
even when the student's intellectual work is strong. A student can produce
excellent analysis while the trajectory also contains signals worth the
teacher's attention.

Describe what you notice without diagnosing. If nothing notable, say so.

Guidelines:
- Frame everything through what {student_name} HAS BUILT, not what they lack.
- This report must work for any course — do not assume a specific subject area.
- Variable output across assignments is normal. Describe it, don't pathologize it.
- Register shifts (passionate to analytical) often reflect the material, not decline.
- If word count or engagement shifted, describe the pattern without attributing cause.
- AAVE, multilingual mixing, and nonstandard English are linguistic repertoire.
- Do not invent quotes. Use only the quotes provided in the semester arc.
- If the data includes teacher priorities, weight your emphasis accordingly.
- If prior feedback is noted, avoid repeating the same suggestions.
- Keep the total report under 600 words."""
